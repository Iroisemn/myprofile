			<h2>MY EXPERIENCES</h2>
			<h3>INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES</h3>
			<h3>Exchange in Spain üá™üá∏</h3>
			<p> I went to spain for six weeks two summers in a row. there i discovered a whole new culture. i lived with a family in a village near madrid. the roads there were not even paved. i discovered catalonia, the beaches and many cities. i also got to taste the typical food and family traditions. So, by having to adapt and make efforts to understand the language outside the walls of the school I made huge progress.  </p>
			<h3>Exchange in England üíÇ</h3>
			<p> The first time i went to england as an exchange student, i was in 7th grade. i stayed there for 2 weeks and had the chance to go to an english school. this way, i was immersed in the english culture, school sports and uniforms. I then went back twice for 2 weeks each time to a friend's house that I had made. the second time, we even spent 2 weeks in Scotland. I loved the food, the scenery and I even had the chance to see the harry poter train and the lake of loc ness.</p>
			<h3> PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES</h3>
			<h3>Internship in a bailiff's office ‚öñÔ∏è</h3>
			<p> During this internship i had field missions as well as missions inside the office. it was very interesting because i discovered the reality of the bailiff's work. indeed, there are many appriori about this job but bailiffs are sensitive and human too even if their work is not easy every day. i also liked the aspect of investigation that this job requires</p>
			<h3>Internship in an online Business Company üí≤ </h3>
			<p> This internship in an online sales company was very rewarding for me. I had the chance to work in all the main positions of a company. I was able to discover pricing audit, I had to respond to customer complaints, and do marketing site dsign. From a logistical point of view, I did stock analysis and warehouse visits ...
